Write a backend service with a language/web framework of your choice to generate an ERC-4337 smart wallet/account. The service should have only one endpoint [GET] /create-account

    Calculate the counterfactual address by interacting with the SimpleAccountFactory contractâ€™s getAddress function
    The address owner parameter should be an address you programmatically generated using a 12-word mnemonic
    Write a util function in your backend service to submit an EIP-4337 user operation from your smart account to a bundler endpoint 

Technical Notes
    Use a testnet node of your choice
    SimpleAccountFactory contract address: 0x9406Cc6185a346906296840746125a0E44976454
    Do not use web3js/ethers.js or any web3 client libraries for interacting with a node or bundler API
    You can use the Bundler API from Stackup.sh
